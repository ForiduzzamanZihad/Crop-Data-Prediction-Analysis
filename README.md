# Crop-Data-Prediction-Analysis
A CSV file called "crop" that contains crop production data from an unidentified source is being examined by the code above. csv". The analysis uses the pandas library for data manipulation, the seaborn and matplotlib libraries for data visualization, and data cleaning and exploration.<br>

The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, including matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and numpy. The read_csv function is used to read the crop data into a pandas dataframe. To obtain details about the data, such as column names, data types, and the number of non-null values, the info function is used. The first five rows of the dataframe are shown using the head function.<br>

The dropna function is then used to remove any missing values from the data. Additionally, rows with a Production value of 0 are eliminated. A second call to the info function verifies that the data does not contain any missing values.<br>

The code then investigates various facets of the data, such as the quantity of distinct states, seasons, and crops in the data. Crop production is represented graphically using bar plots and line plots, which can also show crop production by season.<br>

Using bar plots, the top 10 crops grown in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka are identified and displayed. Also identified and displayed using bar plots are the top and bottom 55 crops produced in India.<br>

The code also examines the production of the data's coconut and sugarcane crops, showing bar plots and line plots to show their development over time.<br>

Overall, the code provides a thorough examination of the crop production data, spotting trends and patterns in the data and presenting the outcomes using a variety of data visualization techniques.
